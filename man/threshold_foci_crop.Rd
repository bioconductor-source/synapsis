\usage{
threshold_foci_crop(image, offset_factor, brush_size, brush_sigma, stage)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{foci channel image}

\item{offset_factor, }{Pixel value offset used in thresholding of foci channel}

\item{brush_size, }{size of brush to smooth the foci channel. Should be small to avoid erasing foci.}

\item{brush_sigma, }{sigma for Gaussian smooth of foci channel. Should be small to avoid erasing foci.}

\item{stage, }{meiosis stage of interest. Currently count_foci determines this with thresholding/ object properties in the dna channel. But will be classified using ML model in future versions.}
}
\value{
A black white mask with foci as objects
}
\description{
Creates mask for foci channel
}
